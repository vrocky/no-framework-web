Here’s a refined version that removes the misleading "close to the metal" analogy and instead emphasizes architectural freedom and design flexibility.

# A Glimpse into Our Implementation

In this tiny example project, we set out to build a simple yet meaningful system that embodies our philosophy: build what you understand, ship what you control. Instead of relying on heavy frameworks, we designed a lightweight custom engine using core web technologies. This approach demonstrates key ideas that provide both transparency and flexibility.

## The Philosophy Behind the Project

We believe that software should be built on clear, understandable principles. By working directly with the core web platform, we gain full visibility into every step of the process. This approach is inspired by larger applications like Visual Studio Code and browser developer tools, where developers prioritize architectural freedom over rigid framework constraints.

Rather than layering abstractions that obscure control, we designed a system that remains simple, predictable, and adaptable.

## What We Did

### 1. JSX and Custom Rendering

Instead of using a framework’s Virtual DOM, we wrote a minimal function that translates JSX syntax into a plain JavaScript object structure. This object directly represents our intended DOM layout. The benefit? You can see exactly how components are structured—no hidden magic.

### 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Hydration

Our project generates static HTML on the server, ensuring a fully rendered page at load time. Then, we "hydrate" the page on the client—attaching event listeners and enabling interactivity without unnecessary re-rendering. This approach balances fast initial loads with a responsive user experience.

### 3. Direct Event Handling

Rather than delegating event management to a framework, we attach event handlers directly to DOM elements. This keeps our code simple, explicit, and easy to debug.

## Why We Took This Approach

- Architectural Freedom: By designing our own rendering, SSR, hydration, and event system, we retain full control over how the system evolves. This flexibility allows us to adapt without framework limitations.
- Optimized Simplicity: Our example demonstrates how a well-structured, minimal implementation can achieve efficiency without unnecessary overhead.
- Deep Understanding: Writing each part ourselves means we’re not just using a framework—we’re gaining deeper insights into how the web works, making debugging and optimization more intuitive.

## In Summary

This example project is a modest demonstration of a “no-framework” approach. We built a system using custom JSX translation, server-side rendering with hydration, and direct event handling.
