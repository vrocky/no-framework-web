# Small Projects, Big Philosophy

In today’s fast-paced AI era, it’s easy to get swept up in the latest tools and frameworks. But when it comes to small projects, there's beauty in simplicity. You don’t need to pull in random code from countless libraries—instead, you can craft a small, understandable foundation and even grow your own framework over time.

## Why Small Projects Don't Need Random Code

For smaller projects, using a mishmash of external libraries can introduce unnecessary complexity and obscure what the code really does. Instead, a focused, minimalist approach can be more beneficial. When you write your own core functions and modules:

- Clarity Wins:Every piece of code is written by you, so you fully understand how it works. This means easier debugging, better performance tuning, and a system that you can confidently maintain.


- Tailored to Your Needs:Instead of forcing a generic framework to fit your unique requirements, you build exactly what you need. This targeted approach avoids bloat and keeps your project lean and efficient.


- Room to Grow:Starting small doesn’t mean you’re locked in. Over time, as your understanding deepens and your needs evolve, you can expand your minimal core into a fully-fledged framework. This gradual evolution ensures that every addition is purposeful and well-understood.



## Building Your Own Framework Over Time

Software engineering isn’t just about writing code—it’s about creating tools that empower others. In many ways, the work of a skilled software engineer is to design frameworks that serve as robust foundations for others to build on. Here’s why this mindset is so powerful:

- Frameworks Are Tools for Trained Developers:Trained developers know how to leverage frameworks to build complex systems quickly. But behind every great framework is a foundation built with care and deep understanding. By starting small and creating your own, you’re not only solving your immediate problem—you’re laying the groundwork for something that others might use and build upon later.


- Evolving with the AI Era:As AI and automation continue to reshape the development landscape, there’s a growing need for frameworks that are transparent and adaptable. By developing your own foundational system, you set the stage for future innovation. Over time, you can integrate AI-driven insights or automate repetitive tasks, all while keeping control over your core logic.


- A Clear Division of Roles:There’s a fundamental difference between those who build frameworks and those who use them. Software engineers and architects often invest time in developing robust, well-designed frameworks, knowing that trained developers will later use these tools to build applications. This distinction means that if you’re willing to understand and craft your own tools, you can drive the next wave of innovation—ensuring that the systems you build are not only efficient but also deeply understandable.



## In Summary

Our small project is a humble example of how you can build what you truly understand. By avoiding random code and external dependencies, you create a clear, maintainable system that grows with your needs. This approach honors the traditional role of the software engineer—to develop the frameworks that empower others—and is especially relevant in our current AI-driven landscape.

Embrace the philosophy: start small, build with clarity, and gradually develop your own tools. In doing so, you not only ship software you control but also contribute to a future where every line of code is a building block for larger, more innovative systems.

Build what you understand. Ship what you control.
