# Build What You Understand, Ship What You Control

In a world where modern frameworks promise rapid development but often come with layers of opaque abstractions, there’s a growing movement toward a more hands-on, transparent approach to web development. At the heart of this mindset is a simple, powerful idea:

Build what you understand, ship what you control.

This isn’t a rejection of progress or innovation—it’s a call to reclaim the reins of software craftsmanship by understanding every piece of your application and using the raw power of the web platform to build efficient, maintainable, and predictable software.

## The Problem with Heavy Frameworks

Modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue have transformed web development by streamlining many common tasks. However, they also introduce challenges that can complicate projects in subtle ways:

- Hidden Complexity:Frameworks often abstract away the underlying mechanics of the DOM, making it harder to diagnose performance issues or unexpected behavior. When you rely on a Virtual DOM diffing algorithm or other internal mechanisms, you sometimes end up “fighting the framework” rather than solving real problems.


- Architectural Dependence:Building your application on top of a large ecosystem means that you’re tied to its design decisions, update cycles, and potential breaking changes. This can lead to long-term maintenance headaches and reduced control over performance, especially with highly dynamic or large-scale documents.


- Overhead in Extreme Cases:When dealing with huge dynamic content—think of a 100MB markdown file—the Virtual DOM diff process can become a bottleneck. In scenarios like these, even the best optimizations provided by the framework may not suffice, leaving you with a sluggish and unresponsive application.



## The No-Framework Mindset

Imagine a development approach where you have full control over every single line of code. Instead of leaning on heavy abstractions, you build the components you need from the ground up, harnessing the full capabilities of the web platform. This is the essence of the No-Framework Web mindset.

### Key Principles

1. Full System Understanding:When you write your own classes, manage your own events, and manipulate the DOM directly, you develop an intimate understanding of how your software works. This knowledge empowers you to troubleshoot and optimize performance in ways that generic frameworks can’t match.


2. Direct Control Over Execution:By building a custom rendering pipeline—complete with your own JSX implementation, server-side rendering, and hydration routines—you’re no longer at the mercy of a one-size-fits-all Virtual DOM. Instead, you update only what needs to be updated, using precise and incremental operations that scale efficiently even for very large documents.


3. Sustainable Code:Reducing reliance on external dependencies means fewer surprises. When you build your components and utilities yourself, you know exactly how each part functions. This not only makes your code easier to maintain over time but also helps prevent dependency churn or unwanted framework-specific side effects.



## Our Campaign: Reclaiming Developer Autonomy

Our campaign is built on the conviction that every developer deserves to control the code they ship. We’re championing a return to the fundamentals—a development ethos that prizes clarity, simplicity, and direct manipulation over hidden abstractions. Here’s why this approach matters:

- Performance and Scalability:With direct DOM manipulation and custom hydration techniques, we can build tools that handle even the most demanding tasks—such as rendering dynamic, massive documents—without the overhead of diffing entire virtual trees.


- Empowering Developers:When you understand your system in its entirety, debugging becomes straightforward. Instead of sifting through layers of abstraction to locate a bug, you can see exactly what each line of code does, fostering a deeper connection with your craft.


- Long-Term Maintainability:A lean codebase that minimizes dependencies is easier to maintain. When you write your own classes and manage events directly, you’re insulated from the evolving whims of third-party libraries. Your software evolves in line with your vision and needs.





## The Path Forward

Adopting the No-Framework mindset is not without its challenges. It requires a willingness to dive deep into the core mechanics of web development and to accept more responsibility for every line of code. However, the rewards are significant:

- Enhanced Performance:Experience a smoother, faster user interface even under extreme conditions.


- Greater Transparency:Every part of your application is visible and understandable, making troubleshooting and optimization a straightforward process.


- Empowered Innovation:With a minimal and controlled codebase, you’re free to innovate without the constraints imposed by large, opinionated frameworks.



## Conclusion

The No-Framework mindset is a call for developers to reclaim control. It’s about understanding every detail of the code you ship and building software that is as elegant as it is efficient. By choosing to build your own classes, implement your own rendering and hydration processes, and manage events directly, you’re not just coding—you’re crafting a tool that reflects your deep expertise and commitment to quality.

Join us in this campaign to build software that you truly understand. Let’s redefine what it means to create performant, sustainable, and maintainable web applications. After all, when you build what you understand, you ship what you control.

Embrace the fundamentals. Reclaim your power. Build what you understand.
